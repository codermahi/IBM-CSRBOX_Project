            <h2>Introduction to Climate Change</h2>
           <a href="introduction/new.html"> <p>Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While
                climate change is a natural phenomenon, recent decades have seen a rapid increase in temperatures,
                largely due to human activities.</p></a>

        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
            <a href="causes/new.html"><p>The primary cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human
                activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.</p></a>

        <section id="impacts">
            <h2>Impacts of Climate Change</h2>
            <a href="imapct/impt.html"><p>Climate change impacts include more frequent extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and negative
                effects on wildlife and human health.</p></a>

        <section id="mitigation">
            <h2>Mitigation and Adaptation</h2>
            <a href="mitigation/miti.html"><p>Mitigation strategies involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy, conservation
                efforts, and policy changes. Adaptation involves making adjustments to social, economic, and
                environmental practices to minimize the damage caused by climate change.</p></a>

        <section id="Sustainbility">
            <h2>Sustainbility</h2>
           <a href="susTracker/tracker.html"> <p>Sustainability in climate change focuses on reducing carbon emissions and promoting renewable energy to
                preserve our planet. It involves adopting eco-friendly practices and technologies to minimize
                environmental impact. By enhancing resource efficiency and supporting green initiatives, we aim to
                balance economic growth with environmental health. Collective efforts towards sustainability are crucial
                for securing a livable future for all.</p></a>
