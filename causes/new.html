            <h2>Causes of Climate Change</h2>
            <div class="cause">
                <h3>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
                <p>Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) trap heat in the atmosphere, causing the Earth's temperature to rise. These gases are released from burning fossil fuels, industrial activities, and agricultural practices.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="cause">
                <h3>Deforestation</h3>
                <p>Deforestation involves the large-scale removal of forests, which act as carbon sinks by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When forests are cut down, the stored carbon is released, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cause">
                <h3>Industrial Activities</h3>
                <p>Industrial activities, including manufacturing and energy production, are major sources of greenhouse gases. Factories and power plants often burn fossil fuels, releasing large amounts of CO2 and other pollutants into the atmosphere.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cause">
                <h3>Agriculture</h3>
                <p>Agricultural practices, particularly livestock farming, produce methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Additionally, the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cause">
                <h3>Fossil Fuel Extraction and Use</h3>
                <p>The extraction and burning of fossil fuels for energy is the primary source of CO2 emissions. This includes activities such as oil drilling, coal mining, and natural gas extraction, as well as the consumption of these fuels in transportation and electricity generation.</p>
